### How I understand it

I guess the confusing bit,for me,was understanding that django and websockets are independant.

Web socket documentation : <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket>

django channels : <https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html>

> Before starting read up on the web socket documentation so that you understand more of less what is going on in regrards to the client side

### Now how do these work together?

Channels provide the backend functionality while web sockets handles the client/front-end side of things (meaning itâ€™s always watching for new changes).
